1) INSTALL REMCOS
   Remcos is portable and does not require an installation.
   Just extract Remcos.exe file in any folder and execute it.
   Zip Password is: BreakingSecurity.net
   If later on you download a new Remcos update and want to keep all your settings,
   just place the new Remcos.exe in the same folder.

2) OPEN LISTENING PORT
   The first step to do is open a TCP port for Remcos Controller.
   This port will be used to listen for incoming connections.
   Go to Local Settings -> Connection 
   to add a listening port.
   Make sure your firewall allows Remcos connection.
   
3) SETUP AGENT CONNECTION
   Go to Agent Builder -> Connection 
   to specify where your Remcos Agent should connect.
   You should enter the IP or DNS address and listening port of your Remcos Controller here.

4) BUILD AGENT
   Go to Agent Builder -> Build
   to build a Remcos Agent.
   Deploy the agent to the remote system and execute it.

5) ESTABLISH CONNECTION
   If the above steps were correctly done, 
   your new Remcos connection will popup in the Connections tab.
